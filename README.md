# Flight-fare-prediction - ML Project
A web app to predict fare for some indian flights.

## Motivation
After creating a regression model for flight fare prediction, I was curious to find ways to make an application and convert this into an end-to-end project. I came across this beautiful library - Pywebio, which takes care of the front-end without HTML and CSS.
(Also, I am not good at web development)

## Dataset
Model was trained on the following dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/nikhilmittal/flight-fare-prediction-mh/
